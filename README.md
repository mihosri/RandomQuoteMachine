# Challenges and Success
- Deploying the app was a challenge to me as there were few times the build command failed. Finally I analyzed the root cause from error logs and deployed the app in a 3rd party site called Netlify.

# Learnings

- working with json data.
- applying Math.random() method
- CSS styling.
- react icons.
